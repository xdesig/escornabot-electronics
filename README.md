# escornabot
Educational robot
scornabot is an open source/hardware project that aims to bring robotics and programming to children.

The basic Escornabot can be programmed with the robot's buttons to execute sequence of movements. From this, imagination is the only one limit to the possibilities.

- Hey! That you are describing looks very much like a Bee-Bot!

- Yes, but much better for several reasons. Among them, I will highlight a few:

It is made by you. And your pupils, children, young cousins... Everyone can help by participating in the process from the beginning. The pleasure of building your own escornabot converts the experience in something great, specially when children are involved in it.

It is a open hardware (OSHW) and free software (FOSS) so you can adapt its characteristics to your needs: to put sensors, LEDs, change the aperture angle of rotation, the distance it moves at each step... whatever that comes to mind.
